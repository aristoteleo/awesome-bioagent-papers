# The Applications of LLM-Based Agents in Biology and Medicine

This compilation highlights the burgeoning impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) in the realms of biology and healthcare. The studies emphasize integration in drug discovery, clinical diagnostics, patient interactions, and overall improvement in medical workflows. While the potential benefits are significant, the challenges of implementation, including ethical considerations and the necessity for rigorous evaluation, are also discussed.
